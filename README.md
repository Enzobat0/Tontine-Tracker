# Tontine Tracker — Digital Group Savings Platform
**Description**

Tontine Tracker is a lightweight web application that helps small community savings groups (tontines) manage their collective funds digitally. The app provides an easy way for a tontine leader (group administrator) to create and manage savings groups, track member contributions, and record payouts — reducing confusion and improving transparency.

The goal of this project is to simplify how local savings groups track their contributions and payments, moving away from manual notebooks or spreadsheets toward a simple, accessible digital solution.

**Key Objectives**

- Enable a group leader to create a tontine (savings group).

- Allow adding members, setting contribution amounts, and defining the payout cycle.

- Track contributions and automatically calculate total savings.

- Record and visualize payout history (who has received funds and when).

- Provide transparency and easy reporting for all members.

**Primary Users**

- Group Leader (Admin): Creates and manages the tontine, adds members, records contributions, and logs payouts.

- Members (Viewers): Can view their contribution status and group progress (optional in future versions).
